# useSafeState

Have you ever been caught on `Can't perform a React state update on an unmounted component.`? Of
course you do, we're all been there😅  
Async callback invoked, it tries to set state, but component is already unmounted, that annoying
warning happens, and you have to track component mount state manually.

`useSafeState` covers your back - it tracks component mount state and not performs `setState` action
if component is unmounted, otherwise it is the same hook as common `useState`.

#### Example

Sadly we can't provide an example since this documentation built in `production` mode and warning is
only shown in `development` mode.

## Reference

Use it exactly the same as `useState`.
