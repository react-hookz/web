# useMediatedState

Like `useState`, but every value set is passed through mediator function.

> This hook uses `useSafeState` underneath, so it is safe to use its `setState` in async hooks.

> `setState` returned by this hook is stable between renders.

> **_This hook provides stable API, meaning returned functions does not change between renders_**

#### Example

<Canvas>
  <Story story={Example} inline />
</Canvas>
