# useMeasure

Uses ResizeObserver to track element dimensions and re-render component when they change.

- It's ResizeObserver callback uses RAF debouncing, therefore it is pretty performant.
- SSR friendly, returns `undefined` on initial mount.
- Automatically creates ref for you, that you can easily pass to needed element.

#### Example

<Canvas isColumn>
  <Story name="Example" story={Example} />
</Canvas>

## Reference

```ts
function useMeasure<T extends Element>(): [DOMRectReadOnly | undefined, RefObject<T>];
```

#### Return

Array of two elements:

- **0** _`DOMRectReadOnly | undefined`_ - Current element rect, received from ResizeObserver;
- **1** _`RefObject<T>`_ - Ref objet that should be passed to tracked element;
