# useIsomorphicLayoutEffect

Alias for `useLayoutEffect` in browser, but for `useEffect` at server side. Helps to avoid warning
shown during SSR. [Read Alex Reardon's article](https://medium.com/@alexandereardon/uselayouteffect-and-ssr-192986cdcf7a)

#### Example

There is nothing to show in browser, as this hook affects SSR only.

## Reference

Use it exactly the same as `useLayoutEffect`.
