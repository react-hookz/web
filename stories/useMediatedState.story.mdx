# useMediatedState

Like `useState`, but every value set is passed through mediator function.

> This hook uses `useSafeState` underneath, so it is safe to use it's `setState` in async hooks.

> `setState` returned by this hook is stable between renders.

#### Example

<Canvas>
  <Story story={Example} inline />
</Canvas>

## Reference

```ts
function useMediatedState<S, R>(
  initialState?: S | (() => S),
  mediator?: (state: R) => S
): [S, (value: R | ((prevState: S) => R)) => void]
```
