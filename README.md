`@react-hookz/web` is a library of general-purpose React hooks built with care and SSR compatibility
in mind.

## Install

This one is pretty simple, everyone knows what to do:

```shell
npm i @react-hookz/web
# or
yarn add @react-hookz/web
```

As hooks was introduced to the world in React 16.8, `@react-hookz/web` requires - you guessed it -
`react` and `react-dom` 16.8+.  
Also, as React does not support IE, `@react-hookz/web` does not do so either. You'll have to
transpile your `node-modules` in order to run in IE.

## Usage

This package provides three levels of compilation:

1. **Main**, the `/cjs` folder — CommonJS modules, with ES5 lang level.
2. **ESM**, the `/esm` folder — it is ES modules (browser compatible), with ES5 lang level.
3. **ESNext**, the `/esnext` folder — it is ES modules (browser compatible), with ESNext lang level.

So, if you need the `useMountEffect` hook, depending on your needs, you can import in three ways
(there are actually more, but these are the three most common):

```ts
// in case you need cjs modules
import { useMountEffect } from "@react-hookz/web";
// in case you need esm modules
import { useMountEffect } from "@react-hookz/web/esm";
// in case you want all the recent ES features
import { useMountEffect } from "@react-hookz/web/esnext";
```
