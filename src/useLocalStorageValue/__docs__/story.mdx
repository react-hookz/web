# useLocalStorageValue

Manages a single LocalStorage key.

- Uses JSON serialisation to handle non-string values.
- Tracks window's `storage` event.
- Synchronized between all hooks on the page with the same key.
- SSR compatible.

> **_This hook provides a stable API, meaning the returned methods do not change between renders._**

> Does not allow usage of `null` as a value, since JSON allows serializing `null` - it would be
> impossible to separate `null` value from 'no such value' API result which is also `null`.

> If you are doing SSR, set `initializeWithValue` to `false` in order for this hook to return
> `undefined` on first render. The LocalStorage value will be fetched client-side when effects
> are executed.

> If you are using useLocalStorageValue in multiple places with the same key, all instances must
> use compatible serializers if you are overriding the serializers with the `parse` and `stringify` options.

#### Example

## Reference

```ts
function useLocalStorageValue<
	Type,
	Default extends Type = Type,
	Initialize extends boolean | undefined = boolean | undefined,
>(
	key: string,
	options?: UseStorageValueOptions<Type, Initialize>
): UseStorageValueResult<Type, Default, Initialize>;
```

#### Importing

#### Arguments

- **key** _`string`_ - LocalStorage key to manage.
- **options** _`object`_ - Hook options:
- **defaultValue** _`T | null`_ - Value to return if `key` is not present in LocalStorage.
- **initializeWithValue** _`boolean`_ _(default: true)_ - Fetch storage value on first render. If
  set to `false` will make the hook yield `undefined` on first render and defer fetching of the
  value until effects are executed.
- **parse** _`(str: string | null, fallback: T | null) => T | null`_ - Custom parse function to use instead of JSON.parse
- **stringify** _`(data: unknown) => string | null`_ - Custom stringify function to use instead of JSON.stringify

#### Return

Object with following properties. Note that this object changes with `value`, but its methods are
stable between renders. Thus, it is safe to pass them as props.

- **value** - LocalStorage value of the given `key` argument or `defaultValue`, if the key was not
  present.
- **set** - Set a new value for the managed `key`.
- **remove** - Remove the current value of `key`.
- **fetch** - Manually retrieve the value of `key`.
