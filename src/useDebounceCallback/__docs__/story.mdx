# useDebounceCallback

The third argument is a list of dependencies, as for `useCallback`.

> The third argument is dependencies list on `useEffect` manner, passed function will be re-wrapped
> when delay or dependencies has changed. Changed debounce callbacks still has same timeout, meaning
> that calling new debounced function will abort previously scheduled invocation.

> Debounced function is always a void function since original callback invoked later.
