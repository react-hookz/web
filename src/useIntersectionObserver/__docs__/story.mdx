# useIntersectionObserver

Tracks intersection of a target element with an ancestor element or with a top-level document's viewport.

- SSR-friendly.
- Effective - uses single `IntersectionObserver` for hooks with same options.
- Allows using React reference as root.
- Does not produce references for you.

#### Example

<Canvas>
  <Story story={Example} inline />
</Canvas>

## Reference

```ts
export function useIntersectionObserver<T extends Element>(
  target: RefObject<T> | T | null,
  { threshold = [0], root, rootMargin = '0px' }: IUseIntersectionObserverOptions = {}
): IntersectionObserverEntry | undefined;
```

#### Arguments

- **target** _`RefObject<T> | T | null`_ - React reference or Element to track.
- **options** - Like `IntersectionObserver` options but `root` can also be react reference.
  - **threshold** _`RefObject<Element | Document> | Element | Document | null`_
    _(default: `document`)_ - An `Element` or `Document` object (or its react reference) which is
    an ancestor of the intended target, whose bounding rectangle will be considered the viewport.
    Any part of the target not visible in the visible area of the root is not considered visible.
  - **rootMargin** _`string`_ _(default: `0px`)_ - A string which specifies a set of offsets to add
    to the root's bounding_box when calculating intersections, effectively shrinking or growing the
    root for calculation purposes. The syntax is approximately the same as that for the CSS margin
    property.
  - **threshold** _`number[]`_ _(default: `[0]`)_ - Array of numbers between 0.0 and 1.0, specifying
    a ratio of intersection area to total bounding box area for the observed target. A value of 0.0
    means that even a single visible pixel counts as the target being visible. 1.0 means that the
    entire target element is visible.

#### Return

`IntersectionObserverEntry` as it is returned from `IntersectionObserver`
