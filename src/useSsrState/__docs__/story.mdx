# useSsrState

Combination of hook and context provider that allows to seamlessly, and once for all
`@react-hookz/web` hooks, declare that application is server-rendered. All you have to do is wrap
your application with `<SsrStateProvider>` component - it will provide static value that can be only
changed via props and accessed over `useSsrState` hook.

Every isomorphic hook that has to change it's behavior depending on environment will do it basing
off this hook state.

In case there is no upper context provider, or provider has `disabled` prop - `useSsrState` will
yield false.

#### Example

<Canvas>
    <Story story={Example} inline/>
</Canvas>

## Reference

```ts
function useSsrState(): boolean;
```

#### Importing
