`@react-hookz/web` is a library of general-purpose React hooks built with care and SSR compatibility
in mind.

## Install

This one is pretty simple, everyone knows what to do:

```shell
npm i @react-hookz/web
# or
yarn add @react-hookz/web
```

As hooks was introduced to the world in React 16.8, `@react-hookz/web` requires - you guessed it -
`react` and `react-dom` 16.8+.
Also, as React does not support IE, `@react-hookz/web` does not do so either. You'll have to
transpile your `node-modules` in order to run in IE.

## Usage

> This package distributed with ESNext language level and both, CJS and ES imports.  
> It means that depending on your browser target you might need to transpile it. Every major
> bundler provides a way to transpile `node_modules` fully or partially.
> Address your bundler documentation for more details.

You can import hooks two ways:

```ts
// from the root of package
import { useMountEffect } from '@react-hookz/web';
// or single hook directly
import { useMountEffect } from '@react-hookz/web/esm/useMountEffect';
```

In case your bundler supports tree-shaking (most of modern does) - both variants are equal and only
necessary code will get into your bundle. Direct hook imports should be considered otherwise.  
In case, for some reason, you are not able to use ES imports - you should direct-import hooks from
`@react-hookz/web/esm` folder.

## Migrating from react-use

`@react-hookz/web` was built as a [spiritual successor](https://github.com/streamich/react-use/issues/1974)
of `react-use` by one of its former maintainers.
