---

`@react-hookz/web` is a library of general-purpose React hooks built with care and SSR compatibility
in mind.

## Install

This one is pretty simple, everyone knows what to do:

```shell
npm i @react-hookz/web
# or
yarn add @react-hookz/web
```

As hooks was introduced to the world in React 16.8, `@react-hookz/web` requires - you guessed it -
`react` and `react-dom` 16.8+.
Also, as React does not support IE, `@react-hookz/web` does not do so either. You'll have to
transpile your `node-modules` in order to run in IE.

## Usage

> This package distributed with ESNext language level and ES modules syntax. It helps us to ease the
support and provide you with the best hooks quality.  
> But also this means that depending on your browser target and bundling configuration you might need
to transpile it. Every major bundler provides a way to transpile `node_modules` fully or partially.
Address your bundler documentation for more details.

You can import hooks two ways:

```ts
// from the root of package
import { useMountEffect } from '@react-hookz/web';
// or single hook directly
import { useMountEffect } from '@react-hookz/web/useMountEffect';
```

In case your bundler supports tree-shaking (most of modern does) - both variants are equal and only
necessary code will get into your bundle. Direct hook imports should be considered otherwise.

## Migrating from react-use

`@react-hookz/web` was built as a [spiritual successor](https://github.com/streamich/react-use/issues/1974) 
of `react-use` by one of its former maintainers.
