<Meta title="Side-effect/useCookieValue" component={Example} />

# useCookieValue

Manages a single cookie.

> Requires installation of `js-cookie` package.
> **Should be directly imported as it has optional dependency and therefore it is not exported from
> index file**

- Uses `js-cookie` package underneath.
- SSR-friendly.
- Hooks with the same key on the same page are synchronised. This synchronisation does not
  work across tabs or on changes that are triggered by third-party code.

> **_This hook provides stable API, meaning returned methods does not change between renders_**

> Uses `null` values as indicator of cookie absence, `undefined` value means that cookie value
> hasn't been fetched yet.

> While using SSR, to avoid hydration mismatch, consider setting `initializeWithValue` option
> to `false`, this will yield `undefined` state on first render and defer value fetch till effects
> execution stage.

#### Example

<Canvas columns={3}>
  <Story story={Example} inline />
  <Story story={Example} inline />
  <Story story={Example} inline />
</Canvas>

## Reference

```ts
export type IUseCookieOptions = Cookies.CookieAttributes & {
  initializeWithValue?: boolean;
};

export type IUseCookieReturn = [
  value: undefined | null | string,
  set: (value: string) => void,
  remove: () => void,
  fetch: () => void
];

export function useCookieValue(key: string, options: IUseCookieOptions = {}): IUseCookieReturn;
```

#### Arguments

- **key** _`string`_ - Cookie name to manage.
- **options** _`IUseCookieOptions`_ _(default: {})_ - Cookie options that will be
  used during cookie set and delete. Has only one extra option, that relates to the hook itself:
  - **initializeWithValue** _`boolean`_ _(default: true)_ - Whether to initialize state with
    cookie value or initialize with `undefined` state.  
    _Default to `false` during SSR._

#### Return

0. **state** - cookie value, `undefined` means it is not fetched yet, `null` means absence of
   cookie.
1. **set** - Method to set new cookie value.
2. **remove** - Method to remove cookie.
3. **fetch** - Method to re-fetch cookie value.
