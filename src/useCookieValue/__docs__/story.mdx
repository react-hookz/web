# useCookieValue

Manages a single cookie.

> **IMPORTANT**: Requires separate installation of the `js-cookie` package.

> **IMPORTANT**: This hook should be directly imported as it has an optional dependency and therefore
> is not exported from the index file. See [importing](#importing) section below.

- Uses the `js-cookie` package under the hood.
- SSR-friendly.
- Hooks with the same key on the same page are synchronised. This synchronisation does not work
across tabs or on changes that are triggered by third-party code.

> **_This hook provides a stable API, meaning returned methods do not change between renders_**

> Uses `null` value as the indicator of cookie absence. `undefined` value means that the cookie value
> hasn't been fetched yet.

> While using SSR, to avoid hydration mismatch, consider setting the `initializeWithValue` option to
> `false`. This will make the hook yield `undefined` on first render and defer fetching of the cookie
> value until effects are executed.

#### Example

<Canvas columns={3}>
    <Story story={Example} inline/>
    <Story story={Example} inline/>
    <Story story={Example} inline/>
</Canvas>

## Reference

```ts
export type UseCookieOptions = Cookies.CookieAttributes & {
  initializeWithValue?: boolean;
};

export type UseCookieReturn = [
  value: undefined | null | string,
  set: (value: string) => void,
  remove: () => void,
  fetch: () => void
];

export function useCookieValue(key: string, options: UseCookieOptions = {}): UseCookieReturn;
```

#### Importing

<ImportPath root={false}/>

#### Arguments

- **key** _`string`_ - Name of the cookie to manage.
- **options** _`UseCookieOptions`_ _(default: {})_ - Cookie options that will be used during setting
and deleting the cookie. Has one extra option, that relates to the hook itself:
- **initializeWithValue** _`boolean`_ _(default: true)_ - Whether to initialize state with the cookie
value or `undefined`. _We suggest setting this to `false` during SSR._

#### Return

0. **state** - Value of the managed cookie. `undefined` means the value has not been fetched yet,
`null` means the cookie is absent.
1. **set** - Set new value to the cookie.
2. **remove** - Remove the cookie.
3. **fetch** - Re-fetch the cookie value.
