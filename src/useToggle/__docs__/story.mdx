# useToggle

Like `useState`, but can only become `true` or `false`.

State setter, in case called without arguments, will change the state to opposite. React synthetic
events are ignored by default so state setter can be used as event handler directly, such behaviour
can be changed by setting 2nd parameter to `false`.

> **_This hook provides stable API, meaning returned functions do not change between renders_**

#### Example

## Reference

```ts
export function useToggle(
	initialState: InitialState<boolean>,
	ignoreReactEvents?: true
): [boolean, (nextState?: NextState<boolean> | BaseSyntheticEvent) => void];

export function useToggle(
	initialState: InitialState<boolean>,
	ignoreReactEvents: false
): [boolean, (nextState?: NextState<boolean>) => void];
```

#### Importing

#### Arguments

- _**initialState**_ _`InitialState<boolean>`_ - initial state or initial state setter as for
  `useState`
- _**ignoreReactEvents**_ _`boolean`_ _(default: true)_ - ignore received react synthetic events, so state setter can be used as event handler.

#### Return

Returns array alike `useState` does.

- _**[0]**_ _`boolean`_ - current state
- _**[1]**_ _`(nextState?: NewState<boolean>) => void`_ - state setter as for `useState`. In case
  called without arguments will change state to opposite.
