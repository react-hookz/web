# useResizeObserver

Invokes a callback whenever ResizeObserver detects a change to target's size.

- Uses a singe ResizeObserver for all hook instances, as it is more effective than using per-hook
  observers.
- No need to wrap callback with `useCallback`, because hook manages callback mutation internally.
- Does not apply any throttle or debounce mechanism - it is on end-developer side.
- Does not produce references for you.
- SSR friendly.
- Provides access to `ResizeObserverEntry`

#### Example

<Canvas isColumn>
  Below component uses direct invocation so it is not so optimal in terms of CPU usage, but it gains
  most recent data.
  <Story name="Example" story={Example} />
  As `useResizeObserver` does not apply any debounce or throttle mechanisms to received callback -
  it is up to developer to do so if needed. Below example is almost same as previous but state is
  updated within 500ms debounce.
  <Story name="ExampleDebounced" story={ExampleDebounced} />
</Canvas>

## Reference

```ts
export function useResizeObserver<T extends Element>(
  target: RefObject<T> | T | null,
  callback: (entry: ResizeObserverEntry) => void
): void;
```

#### Arguments

- **target** _`RefObject<Element> | Element | null`_ - element to track.
- **callback** _`(entry: ResizeObserverEntry) => void`_ - Callback that will be invoked on resize.
