# useWindowSize

Tracks inner dimensions of the browser window.

- Does not force `reflow` on every render - only on first mount and resizes.
- SSR-friendly - defaults to 0 during SSR and deferred measuring.
- Performant - uses a single passive event listener for all instances.

#### Example

## Reference

```ts
export interface WindowSize {
	width: number;
	height: number;
}

export function useWindowSize(stateHook = useRafState, measureOnMount?: boolean): WindowSize;
```

#### Importing

#### Arguments

- **stateHook** `<S>(initialState?: S | (() => S)): [S | undefined, Dispatch<SetStateAction<S>>]` -
  State hook that will be used to hold the dimensions of the window.
- **measureOnMount** `boolean` - If `true`, the size of the window will be measured during the effects
  stage, after the component has mounted. If `false`, the window size is measured synchronously during
  the component render. Set this to `true` during SSR.

#### Return

- `object`
- **width** `number` - Window's `innerWidth`
- **height** `number` - Window's `innerHeight`
