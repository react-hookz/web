# useMap

Tracks the state of a `Map`.

- Returned map does not change between renders.
- 1-to-1 signature with the native `Map` object, but its methods are wrapped to cause components to
  rerender with changes.
  Otherwise, it is the JavaScript native `Map` object.
- SSR-friendly.

#### Example

export function useMap<K = any, V = any>(entries?: readonly (readonly [K, V])[] | null): Map<K, V>;
```

#### Importing

#### Arguments

- **entries** _`readonly (readonly [K, V])[] | null`_ - Initial entries iterator for underlying
